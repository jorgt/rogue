Boo boo bla bla

## TO DO

Techy stuff
- Mouse events to recognise block - hover, click and select etc. 

Game stuff
- Increase visibility / ease of use on element decorators in assets
- Fix div position on game initialization
- Try to generate and switch between two grids. 
- Generator for worlds. should not matter if dungeon or overworld etc
- Add different types of landscapes

## IDEAS

Techy stuff
- Move some of the generation server side? This would be faster in Node. 
- Use sockets to stream messages to the client regarding creation status?
- Use sockets to stream 'endless worlds'? Chunk creation of planets/overworlds

Several 'levels'
- world map, with seas, forests, plains etc. Animated blocky clouds on the sides?
- zoomed into a plain, forest whatever, an 'overworld' to walk around in and discover things. towns, caves
- under world. dungeons and caves

All the usual jazz like stats, items, magics.

Extend lightsource to have two radiusses?

Extend AStar to break off after n length

Auto pilot mode. Click a tile, display a trail. Then move player to that tile. If enemy encounter, break auto pilot.
