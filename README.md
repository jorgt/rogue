## TO DO

Major technical hurdles:
- Rewrite screen handling to allow seperately positionable and resizable subscreens.
- Rewrite grid/assets. No need for two grids, can be incorporated. Do not want to store it in assets. Increase visibility / ease of use on element decorators in assets.

## IDEAS

Three 'levels'
1. world map, with seas, forests, plains etc. Animated blocky clouds on the sides
2. zoomed into a plain, forest whatever, an 'overworld' to walk around in and discover things. towns, caves
3. under world. dungeons and caves

All the usual jazz like stats, items, magics.

Extend lightsource to have two radiusses?

Extend AStar to break off after n length

Auto pilot mode. Click a tile, display a trail. Then move player to that tile. If enemy encounter, break auto pilot.
