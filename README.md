Boo boo bla bla

## TO DO

- Mouse move
- expand world to include roads, towns, cities etc
- make 'zoomed out' version of world
- differentiate between different types of maps eg. worlds, lands, dungeons, cities. 
- expand screens. background draw thingie is basically just to create the images that make up the world. will do the same with dungeons etc. 

## IDEAS

Several 'levels'
- world map, with seas, forests, plains etc. Animated blocky clouds on the sides?
- zoomed into a plain, forest whatever, an 'overworld' to walk around in and discover things. towns, caves
- under world. dungeons and caves
- time. hours/days/months/seasons. that'd be sweet. 
- 

All the usual jazz like stats, items, magics.
