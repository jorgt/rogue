# Rogue

Boo boo bla bla

## TO DO

- Increase visibility / ease of use on element decorators in assets
- Fix div position on game initialization
- Try to generate and switch between two grids. 
- Generator for worlds. should not matter if dungeon or overworld etc
- Add different types of landscapes

## IDEAS

Three 'levels'
1. world map, with seas, forests, plains etc. Animated blocky clouds on the sides
2. zoomed into a plain, forest whatever, an 'overworld' to walk around in and discover things. towns, caves
3. under world. dungeons and caves

All the usual jazz like stats, items, magics.

Extend lightsource to have two radiusses?

Extend AStar to break off after n length

Auto pilot mode. Click a tile, display a trail. Then move player to that tile. If enemy encounter, break auto pilot.
